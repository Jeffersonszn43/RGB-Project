## RGB Project
##### The purpose of this project is to be a fun and interactive way to explore colors using a Raspberry Pi, a color wheel with eight different colors, a servo motor, a seven-segment display, and five LEDs. When a user enters one of the eight colors on the color wheel, the project responds by:

##### 1. Moving the Arrow: The arrow on the servo motor turns to the selected color. 
##### 2. Displaying a Number: A corresponding number displays on the seven-segment display, starting from 0 for black and going up to 7 for white.
##### 3. Showing a Color: One of the five LEDs covered by a small paper box lights up to display the color of the user. For the colors: Orange and Cyan, two LEDs are required to light up for those two colors to be displayed. For example, to light up the color cyan, we need to mix the colors blue and green.
