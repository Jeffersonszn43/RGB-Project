## RGB Project
##### The purpose of this project is to be a fun and interactive way to explore colors using a Raspberry Pi, a color wheel with eight different colors, a servo motor, a seven-segment display, and five LEDs. When a user enters one of the eight colors on the color wheel, the project responds by:

##### 1. Moving the Arrow: The arrow on the servo motor turns to the selected color. 
##### 2. Displaying a Number: A corresponding number displays on the seven-segment display, starting from 0 for black and going up to 7 for white.
##### 3. Showing a Color: One of the five LEDs covered by a small paper box lights up to display the color of the user. For the colors: Orange and Cyan, two LEDs are required to light up for those two colors to be displayed. For example, to light up the color cyan, we need to mix the colors blue and green.

## Components Used
##### Here is a list of the components used to build the project:
##### - Raspberry Pi Zero W
##### - Breadboard
##### - Servo Motor
##### - Color Wheel (White, Red, Yellow, Orange, Cyan, Blue, Green, Black)
##### - Arrow attached to Servo Motor arm
##### - Seven-Segment Display
##### - Five LEDs (White, Red, Yellow, Blue, Green)
##### - Small paper box used to cover the LEDs
##### - Assorted male to female wires (used for connections between components and Raspberry Pi)
##### - GPIO Pins on the Raspberry Pi

## Usage
##### 1. First run the Python program in Thonny on the Raspberry Pi
##### 2. When prompted, enter one of the following colors: "White", "Red", "Yellow", "Orange", "Cyan", "Blue", "Green", "Black."
##### 3. The Servo Motor will turn the arrow to the selected color on the wheel.
##### 4. The seven-segment display will show the corresponding number for the selected color.
##### 5. One or two of the LEDs will light up for the selected color through the small box.
