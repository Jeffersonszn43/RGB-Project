## RGB Project
##### The purpose of this project is to be a fun and interactive way to explore colors using a Raspberry Pi, a color wheel with eight different colors, a servo motor, a seven-segment display, and five LEDs. When a user enters one of the eight colors on the color wheel, the project responds by:

##### 1. Moving the Arrow: The arrow on the servo motor turns to the selected color. 
##### 2. Displaying a Number: A corresponding number displays on the seven-segment display, starting from 0 for black and going up to 7 for white.
